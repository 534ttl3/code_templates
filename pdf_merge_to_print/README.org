If I have a large collection of alphabetically sorted pdf files that I want to merge into one document in that order so that when printed double-sided, each original pdf file starts on a new sheet, I use this program. 

I just put the exectuable into the same folder as the pdfs and run
#+BEGIN_SRC 
./merge.sh
#+END_SRC
which creates files 0.pdf, 1.pdf, 2.pdf, 3.pdf, ... . I make sure that my original files are backed up in some other folder.
